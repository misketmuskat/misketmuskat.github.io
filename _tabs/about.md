> Born in 1994 in Bursa - where I spent first 19 years of my life, until I moved to Istanbul for higher education. Studied Political Science & International Relations at [Bogazici University](https://bogazici.edu.tr/en-US/Index), but rather than politics, I was more into philosophy and anthropology. Nowadays, I am working as an editor and producer in podcasting business.
